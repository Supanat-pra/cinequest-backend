# 🎬 CineQuest - Frontend

CineQuest is a personal movies and TV shows tracking application that allows users to record what they have watched, rate titles, and write personal reviews — all in one place. It is designed as a **portfolio-quality backend-focused project**, emphasizing clean architecture, API design, authentication, and database modeling.

The core idea behind CineQuest is simple: **track your movie journey and compare your ratings with others**, similar to IMDb, but built from scratch to demonstrate real-world software engineering skills.

CineQuest Backend is a **RESTful API** that powers the CineQuest application.
This service handles **user accounts, ratings, reviews, and watch history**, while fetching movie and TV metadata on-demand from TMDb.

## 🔐 Authentication

- Uses **JWT access tokens**
- Tokens are sent via:

```http
Cookie: accessToken=<token>
```

- Auth middleware validates tokens and injects user context into requests

---

## 🎬 TMDb Integration Strategy

- Movie & TV metadata is fetched **on-demand**
- The database stores **only user-related data**:
  - Name
  - Rating
  - Review
  - Timestamps

This avoids duplicating large external datasets and keeps the database lean.
